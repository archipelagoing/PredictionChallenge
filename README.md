# PredictionChallenge
Your goal in this assignment is to predict whether or not a customer will make a purchase. This will be accomplished by building a prediction model with the use of the training data, and applying it to the testing data.

I first studied the training data set for patterns. For example, one trivial pattern could be, if actual_price < 50, then the customer will make the purchase. 
 
After you have found the best possible model you can, apply it to the testing dataset to determine whether or not a customer will make a purchase. This will be considered your prediction file.

You are required to submit 3 things. Your code, a report (1 page or more) describing your model and the steps you took to get there, and your prediction file.

Note there is no requirement length for the report. Just make sure you include your training data model accuracy, and what the model actually is. If you struggle to produce a high accuracy model, I suggest you document everything you tried in the report. Essentially, the report is a way for me to justify giving you credit even if you are unable to produce the exact desired solution. Thus, spend as much or as little effort on it as you deem fit.

MAKE YOUR TRAINING DATA MODEL ACCURACY % CLEAR

The code file can be submitted in any reasonable format (.R, .ipynb, etc.). Your prediction file should be in .csv format.
